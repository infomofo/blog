We got the [Instant Pot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FLYWNYQ&linkCode=as2&tag=blogmofo-20&linkId=ECBF2AHBV6YTY6CB){:target="_blank"} based on our friend Hisami's [enthusiastic recommendation](http://kit.com/MrsBabySunshine/loved-items/5939-instant-pot-ip-duo60){:target="_blank"} on [kit.com](http://kit.com){:target="_blank"}.

One of the first things I wanted to make was a modified version of [Dan Bauk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Burmese_dishes#Indian_inspired){:taget="_blank"} that my family makes.  It's similar to an Indian Chicken Biriyani.  While the chicken curry and rice are normally prepared separately and baked afterwards.
