We got the [Instant Pot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FLYWNYQ&linkCode=as2&tag=blogmofo-20&linkId=ECBF2AHBV6YTY6CB){:target="_blank"} based on our friend Hisami's [enthusiastic recommendation](http://kit.com/MrsBabySunshine/loved-items/5939-instant-pot-ip-duo60){:target="_blank"} on [kit.com](http://kit.com){:target="_blank"}.

One of the first things I wanted to make was a modified version of [Dan Bauk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Burmese_dishes#Indian_inspired){:taget="_blank"} that my family makes.  It's similar to an Indian Chicken Biriyani.  While the chicken curry and rice are normally prepared separately and baked afterwards.  It's also normally prepared in giant buffet portions, but this is scaled down to serve 4-6 people.

I've modified the recipe provided by [hip pressure cooking](http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooker-chicken-and-rice-one-pot-meal/) but used the burmese spices.

Ingredients
-----------
* Marinade
   * 1 tsp Cumin
   * 1 tsp Coriander
   * 1/4 tsp Turmeric
   * 1 tsp paprika powder
   * 1 tsp chili powder
   * 1 cup yogurt
   * 1 tsp salt
   * 2 Tbsp fish sauce
   * 1 Tbsp Patak's Hot Curry Paste
* 1 Lb. Chicken Thighs with Bone In and Skin On
* 1 diced onion
* 1 chopped shallot
* 5 cloves of garlic, smashed
* 1 Tbsp butter or Ghee
* 2 Tbsp corn oil
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 star anise
* 1 cardamom
* 2 cloves
* 3 tsp tomato paste
* 2 cups of basmati rice

Preparation
-----------
1. Wash and pat dry the chicken thighs. Use a sharp knife to cut deep slices into the thick tissue of the chicken thighs on both sides.
2. Combine all marinade ingredients in a large bowl and all the chicken thighs.  Refridgerate overnight.

Steps
-----
0. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.
1. Use a food processor to blend the chopped onion, shallot, and garlic into a paste with 1 Tbsp of corn oil.
2. Fry the shallot paste with 1 Tbsp of corn oil and 1 Tbsp of butter or Ghee.
3. Add a tsp of Curry Paste.
4. Sautee marinated chicken skin for 4 minutes on each side to brown it, initially starting with the skin side up.
5. Add 3 tsp of tomato paste and 1 cup of water or stock to the Instant Pot.  Close the cooker and cook for 14 minutes at high pressure.
6. Open the cooker, remove the chicken and cover with foil.  Measure out 3.5 cups of the liquid from the pot and discard or reserve the rest.  Add the soaked rice, the 3.5 cups of liquid, and a pinch of salt.  
7. Press the "multigrain" button.
