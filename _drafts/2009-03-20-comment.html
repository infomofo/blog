Virgin America, you're cool and tell me what flights have Wi-Fi, but unfortunately none of your NYC->SFO flights have it.<br /><br />Delta, American - your website doesn't even say which planes have it.  I actually called up Delta Customer Service, asked a CS rep there if my flight would have wi-fi, she said "hm, that's a good question", escalated me to a super, who then told me "maybe check seatguru.com?"  Wow.
