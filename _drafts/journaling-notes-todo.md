title:  Journaling, Notes, and To Do Lists
---
I've been playing around with Journaling this year, and I am trying to work out
the best tools to use for various different journaling activities.

I tried maintaining a bullet journal for the first part of the year and while I
really enjoyed the focus, intentionality, and followthrough it enforced in my
daily life, I found the logistics of carrying around a physical notebook really
limiting. I've gone back to digital products for pretty much all of these
things, but I'm trying to take my Bullet Journal practice with me.

##ToDo Lists

I've settled on using [WorkFlowy](workflowy.com) for maintaining a Todo List.
It's an extremely freeform organizational tool that lets you organize
everything in nested bulleted lists that can be tagged with @ or # signs and
marked as completed so you can get the list down to exactly what you need to
focus on at any given time.

##Journaling

I've been trying to find a good tool for more freeform Journaling as well and
I'm trying to use [Jrnl.sh](jrnl.sh) for this tool.

##Blogging

I'm maintaining a few different blogs now for various purposes and I still
haven't figured out which platform I like the best.
