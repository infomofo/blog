My first real camera that I used for day-to-day photography was the Yashica T4.  It took ridiculously good pictures for a point-and-shoot, and I absolutely loved it.  It was partially because of the Yashica that I was relatively late to the digital photography scene.  <br /><br />I bought a 35mm SLR in college, the Canon Rebel XT.  Since then I've used a string of flimsy digital point and shoot cameras.  <br /><br />A more recent category of camera is labeled "compact enthusiast".  This includes cameras like the Canon G10.
