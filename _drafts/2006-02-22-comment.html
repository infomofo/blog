<b>Drawer</b> is a weird word.  It's about the weirdest word I can think of at this moment.  The more I look at the word <b>drawer</b> the more and more freaked out I get.  <br /><br />For one thing, there's the whole pronunciation thing (ugh, "pronunciation" is a weird word too... I'll have to get back to that later).  According to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=drawer">dictionary.com</a>, the correct pronunciation (!) is "drô'ər" or "drôr", but I'm pretty sure that I say "drōr'ər".  <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Drawer">Wiktionary</a> doesn't even list the pronunciation I seem to use, but it lists several others... of course, that list may have just been created three minutes ago by a crack addict planning on using wiktionary in an elaborate scheme to scam the Russian government.  Furthermore, the word has a different pronunciation as "drawers" when referring to underwear.  Though I do not personally use this construction, but I am familiar with it, having watched "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"; I recall that Will Smith pronounces it "drôz", and I defer to The Fresh Prince as an authority on urban matters such as this.<br /><br />Above all though, <b>drawer</b> is just... one of those words.  If you look at the word <b>drawer</b> too often, it becomes unpronouncible (!), incomprehensible, alien.  Is there a word for words like that?  Words like <b>spies</b> or <b>police</b> that you use every day, but if you flip that switch in your head and just start saying that over and over, you wonder if, the next time you open your mouth, you might be unable to form the syllables that make up the word.  You could even be sitting there at your computer, mouthing out the word to yourself, and think "is that really right?"-- you're pretty sure you know what noises to make, but even when you say it out loud, you question if you've been saying it that way your whole life, or only now that you think about it?   <b>Drawer</b>.  <b>Drawer drawer drawer</b>.  The whole loop just feeds on itself until the word is to awful, terrible, heavy to even comprehend anymore.  Is there a word for words like that?  Or, if this is true for all words if you look at them long enough, is there a word for this phenomenon as a whole (ugh, I'm not liking "phenomenon" too much either... or "liking")?  Until I find out the correct word, I'm going to call these words "<i>Schwerwörter</i>" because everything sounds more important in German.   Banjax.  Banjax to the whole lot of them, I say.
