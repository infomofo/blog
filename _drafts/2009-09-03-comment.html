What the fuck has happened to Tech Crunch??  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/about-techcrunch/">Tech Crunch</a> used to be one of the most prolific and gamechanging blogs in the tech scene.  Their reviews of new sites used to make or break startups.<br /><br />Recently though, I just see a ton of crap in my RSS feed reader from them.  Either crazy unbalanced op-ed pieces on technology, or ENTIRELY non-technical blog posts.  Look, I pick my blogs to cater to a topic.  The same way I'm not expecting the gizmodo guys to review the latest Dan Brown novel, I really don't give a crap what the weirdos at Tech Crunch think about the Brazilian government's tourism industry.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/SqAa-frhB_I/AAAAAAAAAIA/De09ScB-uSM/s1600-h/techcrunchbrazil.bmp"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 255px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/SqAa-frhB_I/AAAAAAAAAIA/De09ScB-uSM/s320/techcrunchbrazil.bmp" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5377327616038602738" /></a><br />So <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/09/03/why-techcrunch-is-not-coming-to-brazil-after-all/">this post today</a> just completely broke the camel's back.  Not only is the subject matter entirely non-technical, but it's just whiny and fucking annoying.  Yeah fine, you had a bad day and everyone has travel problems, but you know what?  I really don't want to hear it.  If you want to whine about your personal problems and whatever that's fine, but start your own personal blog to do this- don't dump this crap on the loyal followers of techcrunch.  <br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/SqAa7EDybUI/AAAAAAAAAH4/23m68-rfUpQ/s1600-h/handshake.bmp"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 310px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/SqAa7EDybUI/AAAAAAAAAH4/23m68-rfUpQ/s320/handshake.bmp" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5377327557084605762" /></a><br />Even the founder, Michael Arrington has been digressing into multi-post rants about how s<a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/07/18/handshake-horror-the-awareness-spreads/">haking hands will spread plague</a> and what not.  As amusing as it is to visualize him as a modern Howard Hughes, I still fail to see how this comes up in the context of a technological review site. <br /><br />I can get my tech news elsewhere, without all the psycho drama, thanks.
