It sounds pretty terrible, the horses are not provided with adequate housing and live in horrible conditions until they are worked to death for the entertainment of tourists. <br /><br />I oppose horse drawn carriages for a completely different reason.  About 6 years ago in midtown manhattan, I was hit-and-ran by a horse drawn carriage driver. <br /><br /><span class="fullpost"><br />So at the time I was living at 53rd and 8th and had a very short commute, a walk to 50th and 7th.  I was standing at the northwest corner of 52nd and 8th, facing east, waiting for a light when this crazy fast carriage going east on 52nd street decided to turn sharply onto 8th avenue at a break-neck speed.  While the horse itself didn't hit me, the carriage swung wide and then slammed into my back, knocking me to the ground.  I was completely caught off guard, but some passersby were nice and helped me to my feet and kind of told me what happened.  The horse carriage had stopped about half a block down the street.  One of the people that helped me up suggested that I should get his insurance info just in case.  It was probably just the adrenaline, but I got up and felt generally ok, so I went up to him and asked for his insurance as a precaution and he just took off!  At that point, we noticed that his license plate area was intentionally obscured with some masking tape. <br /><br />I went back on my way to work, kind of stunned, but feeling ok; a co-worker asked if I was ok, and I asked why, and he pointed out that the back of my shirt was actually ripped, and my shoulder was starting to visibly swell.  It was at this point that I found that I was having difficulty raising my arm above my head, so I decided to just head to the nearby ER. <br /><br />They did some basic mobility tests and checked out the area and determined that I hadn't broken anything or suffered any serious problems, they just suggested Ice packs and painkillers. <br /><br />So in the end, it wasn't really that bad other than the emergency room fee, and I was pretty lucky, all things considered.  Still, those things are a fucking menace and I'll be happy to see them banned.<br /></span>
