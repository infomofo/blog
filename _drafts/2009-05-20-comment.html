So it's been 3 month since I unceremoniously dropped my grey cable box off at the Time Warner office, and it's been pretty great.  Basically I looked at my pretty sweet <a href="http://www.boxee.tv">Boxee</a> set up on my mac mini and I decided I wanted to try and see if I could replace my expensive cable subscription with free offerings from the internet made available through Boxee.  I already don't watch that many shows, so it really wasn't much to cover.<br /><br /><u>Official Sources</u><br /><b>Hulu</b><br />SNL clips<br />30 Rock<br /><br /><b>CBS.com</b><br />How I Met Your Mother<br /><br /><b>Comedy Central</b><br />South Park<br /><br /><b>Joost</b><br />Adult Swim<br />United States of Tara<br /><br /><b>Netflix</b><br /><i>(this basically takes the place of flipping through channels bored).</i><br />L&O reruns<br />Weeds back season<br /><br />The rest of the shows are filled in via bittorrent, namely <a href="http://tvrss.net">TVRSS</a> which is sex on toast.<br /><br /><u>Unofficial Sources</u><br /><b>Bittorrent</b><br />Gossip Girl<br />Big Love<br />Entourage<br /><br />[UPDATE: I decided to take some pretty screenshots]<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--DdVIxI/AAAAAAAAAGo/u3eXAgumZRM/s1600-h/Browsing+RSS+feeds.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 180px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--DdVIxI/AAAAAAAAAGo/u3eXAgumZRM/s320/Browsing+RSS+feeds.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338031062886195986" /></a><br />Once you find the feed you like, put it into your boxee profile (I have separate search feeds for each tv show I like.  The metadata such as the image url is automatically added by boxee.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--OGb2WI/AAAAAAAAAGw/ltOfvOD_zv8/s1600-h/Browsing+Available+Episodes.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 180px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--OGb2WI/AAAAAAAAAGw/ltOfvOD_zv8/s320/Browsing+Available+Episodes.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338031065742956898" /></a><br />Select the episode you want to download.  This list updates as the search feed adds info.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--YqkwfI/AAAAAAAAAG4/2MFZwUZZL6Y/s1600-h/Download+Complete.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 180px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--YqkwfI/AAAAAAAAAG4/2MFZwUZZL6Y/s320/Download+Complete.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338031068578890226" /></a><br />You can monitor all your downloads in a separate screen.  This can happen in the background while you are watching other shows.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--n97wLI/AAAAAAAAAHA/Rxy_Lw8UGG4/s1600-h/Boxee+fills+in+the+Metadata.png"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 180px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xeahvfgtqOM/ShR--n97wLI/AAAAAAAAAHA/Rxy_Lw8UGG4/s320/Boxee+fills+in+the+Metadata.png" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5338031072686620850" /></a><br />Once the show is downloaded, provided the episode is named in a conventional manner that boxee can recommend, it can automatically add metadata such as an episode title, number, description, and screengrab.<br /><br />I like problem solving.  I like looking at each unretrieved show as a project that can be quickly remediated.  So here are the remaining issues I'm still working on:<br /><br /><u>Unresolved issues</u><br />Live events such as the Oscars or sports<br />Small market unsyndicated content<br /><br />So the biggest gap for me personally has been small market shows that don't have enough traction to get torrented and seeded, and are not on distributed channels.  This basically includes <i>The Soup</i> and <i>The Millionaire Matchmaker</i>.  Try as I might, I can't find any channels to get my Patti fix.  And that's a DEALBREAKER, ladies.
