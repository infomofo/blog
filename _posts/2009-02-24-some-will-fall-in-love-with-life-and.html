title: some will fall in love with life and drink it from a fountain that is pouring
  like an avalanche coming down the mountain.

So I got bored and exhausted all my Google reader stories and main page stories, so I got to think about what I do to find the breaking news.  There are a lot of sites that let you see the unfiltered upcoming stories, and in some cases vote on them.  Obviously there's digg, but digg is awful so I can't stand that.  I guess the ones I like so far are:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.neatorama.com/upcoming/">Neatorama's Upcoming Queue</a><br /></li><li><a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/raw">Buzzfeed Raw<br /></a></li><li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/">Reddit</a></li><li><a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">Metafilter</a><br /></li></ul>So far I'm a little disappointed.  Reddit links are kind of scary and look potentially NSFW.  Buzzfeed Raw is largely spam.  Metafilter is kind of like slashdot circa 1999, and Neatorama's upcoming queue is generally very, very boring.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Uh oh.  Buzzfeed Raw just got very NSFW.  Back to work with me.]
