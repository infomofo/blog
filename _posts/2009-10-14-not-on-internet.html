I have a song stuck in my head from a commercial I saw as a child.  It was for some kind of promotion for the Muppet movies maybe being released on VHS.  I only remember the very end of the commercial.  <br /><br /><verbatim><br />(To the tune of "The Muppet Show Theme")<br />All:<br />We've got "The Muppet Movie"<br />"The Great Muppet Caper", too.<br />And you can get a free watch<br /><br />Statler & Waldorf:<br />Did you say get a free watch?<br /><br />All:<br />Yes, you can get a free watch<br />when you see the sign "It's Muppet Time"<br />especially for you!<br /></verbatim><br /><br />Try as I might, I can't seem to find the full lyrics online.  So I'm putting it there.
