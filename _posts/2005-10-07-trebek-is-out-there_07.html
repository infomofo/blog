<div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/50094134/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/29/50094134_9120f9dede_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Trebek is out there" /></a></div>I've been sick the last couple days, which means I've had little else to do but watch <a href="http://www.netflix.com">Netflix</a> DVDs.  I just watched most of <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0106179">X-Files</a> Season 4, and the screenshot on the right here is from "Jose Chung's From Outer Space".  Re-watching that episode now, almost a decade after I first saw that, I can safely and without any hesitation say that it's the coolest episode of any tv show ever.  It has pretty much everything you might want in an episode, including <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0042876">Rash√¥mon</a> style unreliable poly-narration, big-headed gray aliens, government men in black, and a cameo by the venerable Alex Trebek (pictured in the aforementioned screenshot). <br /><br />On an unrelated note, I like Nyquil a lot.  I mean, really a lot.  If I still used "hella" as an adverb, it would be used here to describe my feelings for Nyquil.
