<div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><img width="200px" src="http://www.apple.com/ipodhifi/images/indexfamilyon20060228.jpg" alt="X210?" /></div>I don't know why most of the Apple event <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/28/live-from-the-steve-jobs-keynote-fun-new-products/">recappers</a> left off the most important part of Stevie-J's keynote, so i've transcribed it here.<br /><br /><blockquote><br />10:49 Oh, one more thing... [The crowd goes wild]<br />[Steve pulls off back panel of iPod Hi-fi to reveal a fat wad of cash.]<br />10:51 Every $350 iPod Hi-Fi comes with $200 cash in the back of it!  That's why the damn thing costs so much!  It will also be available in a $450 version that comes with $300 dollars.<br />[Much applause from apple shareholders.  Exeunt omnes]<br /></blockquote><br />Much better.
