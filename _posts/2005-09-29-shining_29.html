My friend Rob is an internet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">meme</a>... and not one of the dirty ones!<br /><br />He made a trailer for a contest, in which he had to re-cut a movie into a misleading trailer.  The result is <a href="http://www.ps260.com/molly/SHINING%20FINAL.mov">just awesome</a> (mirrored <a href="http://waxy.org/random/video/shining_redux.mov">here</a> if the ps260 server gets hosed again).  After he had submitted the original entry to the contest (which he won), he sent this link out to a few friends.  We all thought it was pretty funny and forwarded it on, and now, maybe a month later, he's all over the place.  Check out links 2-10 on the first page of hits on <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com/blogsearch?hl=en&q=shining&btnG=Search+Blogs">Google Blogsearch</a>.<br /><br />As an executive producer for Rob's student movie (this means that I had to go to the vending machines to buy diet sodas for our actors), I can't help but feel proud.  <br /><br /><i>UPDATE: It's gotten crazy.  Last night, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/30/movies/30shin.html">The New York Fracking Times</a> ran an article on Rob.  We had to go over to his office to help him deal with the vapors. <b>I'd make sure you watch the actual video before reading the nytimes article, because they kind of ruin the whole joke</b>.  And no, it's not my blog they're talking about, they're talking about <a href="http://www.xanga.com/elfollador">Dustin's Xanga</a>.  I only posted it after it went hollywood.</i>
