Well, it's been a fun month, but I have to say <i>sayonara</i> to this blog and <i>hola</i> to my new blog, a WordPress blog hosted at <a href="http://infomofo.blogsome.com/">infomofo.blogsome.com</a>.  In parting, I'd like to say that my experience with blogger was pleasant, and of course was aided by the fact that Blogspot is something of a commodity standard now.  As all my friends were on blogspot accounts, it made it easy to cross-post, etc.  However, I decided to switch based on:<br /><ol><br /><li>Lack of tagging - This was huge.  I tried some third-party solutions like technorati and delicious, but it was too much work.  WordPress supports this out of the box.</li><br /><li>Lack of freedom - WordPress blogs on blogsome are pretty much fully customizable, and the forced content is much less noticeable than the blogger bar.  (In fact, if you have adblock, you won't even see the google pageads).</li><br /></ol><br />That being said, I'll miss a few features from blogger-   Blogger is much more user-friendly when it comes to changing themes (I'm still having some CSS issues, as you'll notice), and is a little more intuitive in its interface.  Blogsome's admin interface is also a little slow sometimes.   Well, I'll see you on the flipside.
