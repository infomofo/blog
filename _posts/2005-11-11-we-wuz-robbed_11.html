<div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/18544978/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/12/18544978_a8376d3449.jpg" width="300" alt="Kwik Meal" /></a></div>The first annual <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/11/nyregion/11vendors.html">Vendy Awards</a> were held last night.  While I appreciate the awarding community's attempt to honor the street vendors that sustain me so well, I was a little shocked that they overlooked the best street vendor ever.  Kwik Meal is so awesome I have trouble forming sentences about it in my mind  without drooling all over my keyboard.  I have a lot of friends who evangelize for the Halal Cart man (I even know someone who dressed up as him for halloween), but I gotta tell you all, Kwik Meal is where it's at.
