So I'm a week late, but I just watched the first ep of the new BSG season and:<br /><br />VERY LATE SPOILER AFTER JUMP<br /><span class="fullpost"><br />Ellen Tigh is the final Cylon.  <br /><br />Ron Moore says he's been planning this for a while, and I believe him.  For example, remember that episode in season 2 where Ellen was trying to get a gmail account and had trouble solving the CAPTCHA?  It all makes sense now.<br /></span>
