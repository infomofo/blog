<i>an excerpt from my unpublished book: 101 Final Fantasy Spells.</i><br /><br />Final Fantasy spells are a synthetic language with a moderate-to-high degree of inflection which shows up mostly in the spell conjugation.<br /><br />The Final Fantasy spell system is separated into 3 distinct inflections indicating the degree of the spell.  Final Fantasy spells represent a pro-drop language, as the object of the spell is generally limited by the intention.<br /><br />A large number of spells are irregular. The rest fall into one of three regular conjugations, which have -r<i>x</i> endings (where <i>x</i> represents any vowel or affricative consonant sound.<br /><br />The basic -r<i>x</i> ending typically indicates a single target, while the advanced ending -ra typically indicates a more powerful single target (formal).  The multiple target ending is -raga, and the most powerful (although uncommonly used) suffix is -raja.  If a spell name is longer than 8 characters then the -raga and -raja endings are frequently shortened to -ga and -ja.<br /><table border="1"><tbody><tr><th>yó/tú</th><th>usted</th><th>nosotros/vosotros</th><th>ustedes</th><th>notes</th></tr><tr><th colspan="5">BasicSpells</th></tr><tr><td>Fire</td><td>Fira</td><td>Firaga</td><td>Firaja (uncommonly used)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Cure</td><td>Cura</td><td>Curaga</td><td>Curaja</td><td></td></tr><tr><tr><td>Blizzard</td><td>Blizzara</td><td>Blizzaga</td><td>Blizzaja</td><td></td></tr><th colspan="5">Irregular Spells</th></tr><tr><td>Thunder</td><td>Thundara</td><td>Thundaga</td><td>Thundaja</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Esuna</td><td>N/A</td><td>Esunaga</td><td>N/A</td><td>As Esuna has no qualitative measure,only the single target and multiple target versions have any distinct inflection.</td></tr><tr><td>Break</td><td>N/A</td><td>Breakga</td><td>N/A</td><td>As Break has only a binary reaction, there are no qualitative modifiers for it.  It should also be noted that "Breakga" is a stupid name.</td></tr><tr><td>Quake</td><td>N/A</td><td>Quakega</td><td>N/A</td><td>The augmented power inflections for quake were never established, probably to avoid offending quakers.  It should also be noted that "Quakega" is a stupid name.</td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><i>If I ever create a pop song that will have a corresponding dance craze, it will be called "Do the meteo now".</i>
