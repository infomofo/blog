<div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><img src="http://www.frescopictures.com/movies/ender/ender.jpg" /></div>A well-read friend of mine sent me a disturbing e-mail the other day.  After another friend recommended <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0812550706">Ender's Game</a> to her, she discounted the book after reading the amazon review:<br /><blockquote><i>I just started to read the Amazon synopsis of Ender's Game and had to stop reading after this sentence: Aliens have attacked Earth twice and almost destroyed the human species.<br /> <br />I don't think I can comment on this.</i></blockquote>I consider this friend to be one of the most reliable litmus tests in terms of book recommendations; to see her reject a book out of hand (cart?) because of the mention of "Aliens" showed a closed mindedness that was disappointing, but not at all unusual, given the broad perception of the sci-fi genre as a whole.  Between Star Trek Conventions and Hollywood remakes of Philip K. Dick novels, science fiction books and movies are generally seen as a niche, cult-appeal, sensationalist works meant mostly for the off-hours Dungeons & Dragons crowd looking for a break from the orc-hunting.  <br />
