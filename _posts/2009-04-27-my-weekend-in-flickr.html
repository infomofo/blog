There were a billion people in Central Park this weekend, each with less clothes than the last.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/3473954481/" title="ZOMG people in Central Park by InfoMofo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3586/3473954481_136f5f36a5.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="ZOMG people in Central Park" /></a><br /><br />Then I got to relive the college experience I never had when my friend (who is like 33 or something) bought a beer pong table for his patio... <br /><br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/3477669215/" title="L1010085 by InfoMofo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3641/3477669215_3070b773f3.jpg" width="500" height="333" alt="L1010085" /></a><br /><br />This is unrelated but the highest number of views for any image in my flickr photostream is for this photo at 31,532.  The next highest is like 4,000.  I think I should find a way to partner with xkcd or something...:<br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/154877897/" title="Dinosaur by InfoMofo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/46/154877897_a299d80baa.jpg" width="375" height="500" alt="Dinosaur" /></a>
