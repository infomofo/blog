I'm switching browsers, from <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org">Camino</a> to <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, which basically completes my transformation into a total Apple Whore.  The only thing keeping me from switching earlier was the lack of an adblocker, and a friend recently clued me into <a href="http://culater.net/thc/index.php?category=/Development/PithHelmet">PithHelmet</a>, an adblocker for Safari that uses the same rules as the original firefox <a href="http://adblock.mozdev.org/">AdBlock</a> plug-in.  However, when explaining this change of heart to <a href="http://thirtyfour.blogspot.com">The Pos</a>, he pointed out that ad revenue is important to the functioning of a small business; by blocking ads I was cutting off funding to sites that I frequented the most.<br /><br />Pos has a sympathy for the small businesses that I do not share; his tenure at <a href="http://www.columbiaspectator.com">The Spec</a> has left him uselessly biased in this case.  However, I find that his and other people's arguments against the individual use of AdBlock falls into these categories:<br /><ol><br />	<li>AdBlocking devalues the model of web advertising; if the practice becomes mainstream and the ad market dries up, companies will turn to more intrusive forms of revenue generation, such as paid registration.</li><br />	<li>AdBlock prevents the content provider from receiving click-through or pay-per-view revenue.</li><br /></ol><br /><br />The first point is one that has plagued the TiVo thirty-second skip from the very beginning.
