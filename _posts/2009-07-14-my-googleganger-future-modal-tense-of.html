Buzzfeed has <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/lindseyweber/googlegangers-ru">a post</a> about "googlegangers", or people with the same name as you that prevent your name from coming to the surface in a google search.  <br /><br />Searching for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=william+chiong">William Chiong</a>" is fairly expected- there are two professional William Chiongs, a dentist and a musician that come up before me, and then you start seeing my name in the context of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.5.4239">a publication</a> I was on in college for <a href="http://monet.cs.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/biblio.pl">the graphics lab</a>, and some limericks andy left in comments on an old blog post of mine.  <br /><br />But my more commonly used nickname provides a bit of a problem.  In "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish">Singlish</a>", english words such as the modal verb "will" are commonly paired with hokkien and slang words such as "chiong" (to be gung ho).  So, when you search for "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=will+chiong">will chiong</a>" you get some of my stuff, peppered with crazy Singaporean blog posts ranging from topics like the stock market to Counter-Strike.  I actually don't really understand the meaning of "chiong" but I have tried to piece it together from the context.  Here are some of the stranger headlines (links removed because it would run counter to my goal of being googlable):<br /><ul><li>"Don't feel bad. Market <i>will chiong</i> up tomorrow. Remember, buy on dips!"</li><li>"CopperTone <i>will chiong</i> weeks worth of homework now."</li><li>"When I let go my accelerator and cross the 2nd last arrow and the light is still green, I <i>will chiong</i>."</li><li>"If they turtle, I <i>will chiong</i>. If they mash SRK, I will bait. If they play normal, I will play cautious."</li><li>"Too bad my laptop broke down or I <i>will chiong</i> this game lol."</li><li>"You never know how the market <i>will chiong</i> in short - mid term due to volatility."</li></ul><br />ARGH people actually talk like this.  If they ever offer a way to kill a phrase Will Chiong will chiong for that opportunity.
