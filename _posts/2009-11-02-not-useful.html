Among other things, the ability to just tap read phone numbers and dial them is an amazing feature that just makes my life easier.<br /><br />That being said, the voice recognition sucks. Every time a friend says "um", or "uh", or swears, it tries to recognize it as a word, and it creates some pretty bizarre sentences.
