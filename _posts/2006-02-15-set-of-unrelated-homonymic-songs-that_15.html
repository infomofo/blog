Ö = { all song titles <i>x</i> : | R(<i>x</i> | > 1 }<br /> <br />Where the function R is a function enumerating all songs with that title that totally rock, but are completely unrelated to one another. <br /> <br />Thus,<br /> <br />Ö = {<br />"Forever Young",<br />"Changes",<br />"One",<br />"Photograph",<br />"Push It"<br />}<br /><br />NOTE: "It's My Life" was a close contender... but the Bon Jovi song really only has cheese factor.
