As I've used the little device for about a week now, I figured it was time for the inevitable review (and plus, I've been pretty light on the blog content this week, so what the hell).  <br /><br /><span class="fullpost"><br />While my 12" Powerbook is only about a year and a half old, my headless linux server was pushing 6 years (which is like a hundred in computer years), and after my last move, I think I jostled it to the point that I couldn't rely on it for basic operations like serving web pages, acting as an ftp server, etcetera.  I'd been planning to replace it since November or so, but I put on the brakes expecting Jobs to announce an update to the line shortly.  When he announced the new Mac Minis, I was pretty happy with the announced specs, save for the crappy graphics card; and as I was primarily planning to use this for non-graphics intensive operations, I went ahead and ordered the diminutive box within the first hour of its announcement.  It arrived <i>much</i> faster than I expected; not only did it ship the same day that I ordered it, but it was delivered in 2 days despite the fact that I selected 5 day shipping.  I've heard that this is a common experience among people who order in-stock products the same day they are announced.<br /><br /><a name='more'></a><br /><br />First off, I found the Rosetta performance to be acceptable.  Even before I installed the 1GB of RAM I ordered separately, I found the performance of most apps to be responsive if run by themselves.  Non-Universal binary applications like Photoshop were not noticeably slow, and were certainly usable even with the translation hit.<br /><br /><div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/107003006/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/48/107003006_cabc8caae6_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Frontrow Tunes" /></a></div>Though I didn't think much of it from Steve's original announcement, I really took to Front Row.  The interface is very clean, and just animated enough to let you know that it is being responsive.  Before I installed the extra RAM, though, the performance was abhorrent, so you definitely need at least 1 GB of RAM to be using this without a noticeable lag.  Once I had the extra RAM it ran great, and it was a ton of fun to browse through my music, photos, and video files in this way.  I'm definitely going to be using this as my fullscreen music player of choice, and I plan on using it to view downloaded tv shows, and the like.<br /><br />My main criticisms of the system as a whole are:<br /><ol><li>iTunes must be used to organize movie files in Front Row, and there is no clean way of labeling movie files as "tv shows" or "music videos"</li><br /><li>Movie files must be playable in Quicktime, which leaves out a lot of the good bittorrentable files that require obscure codecs.</li><br /><li>Front Row's interface is just similar enough to the iPod to really irritate a heavy user of both.  Aside from the wheel differences, the fact that you can't rate songs while listening to the songs in FrontRow is really annoying.</li></ol><br /><br />All in all though, the Mac Mini has restored my faith in Steve Jobs' ability to pour our Kool-Aid.  Drink up, Mac whores!<br /><br /><div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/infomofo/109925780/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/19/109925780_08ae002e4a_m.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="Set the cover aside" /></a></div>UPDATE: I've uploaded the pictures of the RAM install job to Flickr.  It gets pretty gory...<br /></span>
