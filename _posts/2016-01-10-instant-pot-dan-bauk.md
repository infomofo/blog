One of the first things I knew I wanted to try with my new [Instant Pot](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FLYWNYQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00FLYWNYQ&linkCode=as2&tag=blogmofo-20&linkId=ECBF2AHBV6YTY6CB){:target="_blank"} was to make a modified version of my aunt's [Dan Bauk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Burmese_dishes#Indian_inspired){:taget="_blank"}.  It's similar to an Indian Chicken Biriyani.  While the chicken curry and rice are normally prepared separately and baked afterwards, I wanted to try making it in the Instant Pot.  It's also normally prepared in giant buffet portions, but this is scaled down to serve 4-6 people.

I've modified the recipe provided by [hip pressure cooking](http://www.hippressurecooking.com/pressure-cooker-chicken-and-rice-one-pot-meal/) but used the burmese spices.  It's a sophisticated method that uses one pot, while controlling for the various factors that can come up cooking the two ingredients.

Ingredients
-----------

![Aromatics](/images/rice_aromatics.jpg)

* Marinade
   * 1 tsp Cumin
   * 1 tsp Coriander
   * 1/4 tsp Turmeric
   * 1 tsp paprika powder
   * 1 tsp chili powder
   * 1 cup yogurt
   * 1 tsp salt
   * 2 Tbsp fish sauce
   * 1 Tbsp Patak's Hot Curry Paste
* 1.5 Lb. Chicken Thighs or Drumsticks with Bone In and Skin On
* 1 medium chopped white onion
* 1 chopped shallot
* 5 cloves of garlic, peeled
* 1 Tbsp butter or Ghee
* 2 Tbsp corn oil
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 star anise
* 1 cardamom
* 2 cloves
* 1 Tbsp tomato paste
* 2 cups of basmati rice

Preparation
-----------
1. Wash and pat dry the chicken thighs. Use a sharp knife to cut deep slices into the thick tissue of the chicken thighs on both sides.
2. Combine all marinade ingredients in a large bowl and all the chicken thighs.  Refridgerate overnight.

Steps
-----
0. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.
1. Use a food processor to blend the chopped onion, shallot, and garlic into a paste with 1 Tbsp of corn oil.
2. Fry the shallot paste with 1 Tbsp of corn oil and 1 Tbsp of butter or Ghee.
3. Add a tsp of Curry Paste.
4. Sautee marinated chicken skin for 4 minutes on each side to brown it, initially starting with the skin side down.
5. Add 1 Tbsp of tomato paste and 1 cup of water or stock to the Instant Pot.  Close the cooker and cook for 14 minutes at high pressure using either the "Poultry" or "Manual" setting.
6. Open the cooker, remove the chicken and cover with foil.  Measure out 3.5 cups of the liquid from the pot and discard or reserve the rest.  If the total liquid left in the cooker doesn't make 3.5 cups, then add water to top it up to that point.  Add the soaked rice, the 3.5 cups of liquid, and a pinch of salt, the cardamom seeds, cloves, mustard seed, star anise, and cumin seed back to the pressure cooker.
7. Press the "multigrain" button and cook for 3 minutes.  After it is done, let it rest in the Keep Warm mode for 10 minutes before releasing the pressure.
8. (Optional) While the rice is cooking, you can put the chicken in the oven and broil it on a low setting, skin side up until the skin is golden brown and crispy.

To serve, layer in a serving dish or in individual bowls with rice and chicken alternating.  If you like, you can garnish with cilantro, red onion, and lime.
