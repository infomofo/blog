Here's a funny thing I just noticed.  One of the Register articles today was posted with the enticing headline "<a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=anonymizer+register">Anonymizer looks for chinks in the Great Firewall of China</a>".  Funny right?  Even funnier is if you follow the link through, you will see that the Register has prudently changed the name from "chinks" to "gaps".  Who knows how long the google search page will be live, but I've screenshotted it for truth:<br /><a href="http://infomofo.googlepages.com/anonymizier_chinks.PNG"><img src="http://infomofo.googlepages.com/anonymizier_chinks_inset.PNG.bmp"/></a><br />Get it?  Chinks?  China?  That British wit gets me every time.
