<div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><img width="200px" src="http://www.thomaspink.co.uk/us/promotion_pinkpanther.jpg" alt="Get it?  he's the... pink... panther!" /></div><br />Thomas Pink was clearly a classy brand up until about six months ago, so what the hell are they doing?  First I hear about this <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/23/thomas-pink-ipod-tie-keeps-your-nano-on-your-neck/">stupid iPod nano tie</a>, which everyone is quick to point out will be unavoidably uncomfortable, and well, retarded.  Fine, plenty of high-fashion brands have tried to profit off of the iPod or PSP brands with overpriced unusable accessories.  However, right after that I backed out to their <a href="http://www.thomaspink.co.uk/us/">main US page</a> and am greeted by... The Pink Panther?  <br /><br />OK, ok, back up there fella.  About three years ago, Thomas Pink was the pinnacle of metro fashion; a businessman's way of declaring individuality from behind a boring double-breasted suit.  Even pre-Queer-Eye, this posh british import convinced us that you can wear pink and purple stripes while still grooving on the vertical smile.  <a href="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/listings/stores/thomas_pink00/">New York magazine</a> still refers to the store as "a wardrobe mainstay for cosmopolitan businessmen."  Any New Yorker who visited <a href="http://www.google.com/local?hl=en&lr=&q=thomas+pink&near=New+York,+NY">a Pink store</a> during their seasonal sale days would be confronted with a veritable shopping bloodbath, with grown men tearing through stacks of clothing like twenty-something girls at a Louis Vuitton sample sale.  <br /><br />Maybe they've just spread too fast.  While it used to be a arduous task to find the oddly located Pink stores, they now have locations in prime spots, such as the <a href="http://www.shopsatcolumbuscircle.com/scs/user/index.aspx">Time Warner Center</a> (which, let's face it, kills <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/27/nyregion/27trotter.html?ex=1285473600&en=fb523dcd995837a1&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">everything</a> it <a href="http://www.newyorkmetro.com/listings/restaurant/v_steakhouse/">touches</a>).  In either case, why would they tie their upscale menswear brand to <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/pink_panther/">a mediocre kids movie remake</a>?  OK, I get it... you both have the word "Pink" in your title.  But are they really trying to spread the message "when you think of our brand, think of cheap foreign accent and fart jokes"?
