<div style="float: right; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: 10px;"><img width="200px" src="http://infomofo.googlepages.com/X210.jpg" alt="X210?" /></div>We have zero idea what this thing is, if it's real, or if it's some kind of factory leak, but this does look a bit promising as the new Dell Dimension B210 that fans have been speculating about for a while now (and yeah, we're assuming that's a USB slot at the bottom there).  Dell Inc.'s marketing department has yet to confirm or deny the veracity of these leaked pictures, but they certainly look like they are in keeping with the existing Dimension aesthetic that fans have come to recognize.  A VERY GOOD SOURCE suggests that these exciting new boxes will ship with 256 MB of DDR SDRAM, a CD/DVD combo drive and a whopping 80 GB Hard Drive!  <br /><br />More details are expected at Dell's widely expected press event this Thursday, and we will be sure to post more news as it comes to us!
