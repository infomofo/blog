For some reason, the fact that they reduced the price on the dell mini 9 by 50 bucks prompted me to buy one.  I'm gonna hackintosh it.<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://i.gizmodo.com/5161421/dell-mini-9-is-down-to-200-for-one-day-only"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 100%;" src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/02/mini9_hackintosh_8.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />It will be sweet.  This will make the 4th mac machine in my house.  I'd like to pretend they will still have defined roles in the technology hierarchy of my tiny studio apartment, but that remains to be seen.  If anything, this can be my cheap travel laptop that I won't miss when it gets jacked from my hotel room in Brazil.
