It's the coolest thing I've seen there since my friend Erik almost spilled a drink on a Monet at the opening last year.<br /><br />It's a thorough comparison of the work contributed by the two artists while they were living in close proximity and painting prolifically, their styles influencing each other and mixing in unpredictable ways. It was also where I discovered that I missed my calling as a curator. Had I my druthers, the exhibit would have been called "<i>Cezanne: The Bizarro Pissarro</i>".  My friend Jen thought the exhibit should be more focused on their close relationship, and suggested "<i>Cezanne and Pissarro: BFF</i>".<br /><br /><span class="technoratitag">Tags: <a href="http://del.icio.us/infomofo/art" rel="tag">art</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/infomofo/comic_books" rel="tag">comic_books</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/infomofo/MoMA" rel="tag">MoMA</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us/infomofo/museum" rel="tag">museum</a></span>
